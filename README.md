Hey shitass, watch me regain my freedom to play Minecraft modpacks without stupid arbitrary restrictions on who can download them!

## What is this for?

Some vendors (not pointing fingers here, they know really well what they are doing) force you to use their "App" to download Minecraft modpacks.

Not only is it "enshittification" further, requiring an "app" for every little useless thing which should be able to be done just directly, but who knows what privacy concerns it could raise. I'm sure as hell not giving up on my privacy even more than I have to just to play a stupid modpack.

But that pales in comparison that they arbitrarily limit who can run their stupid "app", meaning you may have everything ready to download the modpack, but they block you out because you're using a too new Windows version, or you chose to use Linux. Too bad, they won't let you!

So, using publically available information I found *only on the vendor's website* (I did NOT use 3rd-party websites for my research!), I've made it so you can download their modpacks without any of the issues above.

## How to use this?

You should not. This is just a functional proof of concept.
